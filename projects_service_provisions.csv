After the information meeting senior citizens have a one-on-one appointment with the physiotherapist or exercise coach to look together at all aspects that can influence falling. For example, they look at whether senior citizens can see well, which medicines they use and whether they are often dizzy. The physiotherapist or exercise coach advises them on this or refers them to other healthcare providers. Subsequently, it is examined which of the two exercise courses suits senior citizens best. Stevig Staan offers two different exercise courses. The course 'Vallen Past Time' and the course 'In Balance'. The 'Vallen Past Time' course lasts five weeks. This group course consists of an obstacle course, games and fall training. Hazardous situations from everyday life are practiced under safe conditions on the obstacle course. The game forms contain exercises with many changes in speed and direction, creating chaos. Senior citizens learn to properly adapt their movements to the environment and to start and stop on time. They will also practice various fall techniques to learn how to fall as safely as possible. The 'In Balance' course lasts fourteen weeks. This group course consists of exercises, tests and information about movement and balance. During the training weeks senior citizens perform practical exercises. These exercises are based on the principles of Tai Chi and are designed to improve balance and muscle strength.",,,,,,,,Health care provider - including dozen of organisation under the leadership of De Zorggroep
