In other cases, the name that appears at the top of the resume takes care of that. While none of these things have to mean that the job seeker would not be competent. With the IOD method, the CV is omitted and the focus is only on the needs of the employer. The employer no longer chooses on the basis of CVs: it is the jobseeker who chooses his job and position based on the job offers – at least three – that are offered to him or her. The roles are thus reversed, which not only avoids discrimination in recruitment, but also involves the job seeker – who is no longer called a job seeker, but “professional” – more in the process.",Employment and training,,,,,source1,,Job seekers with a low level of education or job seekers who have been unemployed for more than 2 years.,750,Individual,,,,,source1,,,,
