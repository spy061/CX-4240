It required that the children interact, on a one-on-one basis (without their caregivers), with a stranger (the trained assessor), in a strange environment (the testing location) for 45 minutes.

Performance of the program was measured by cumulative incremental work and work-like hours relative to jobactive. The employment outcomes achieved to date demonstrates the program may not deliver substantial employment outcomes above jobactive services. 36 young people sustained employment for at least 26 non-consecutive weeks within the 60 week program. They worked an average of 22 hours per week, with two thirds increasing their average hours of work per week during their engagement with STP. When only considering participants who have completed the program, the average participant recorded 475 approved hours of work, over 19 weeks. While one third of participants were able to engage with employment, there is evidence of a significant drop off in sustained employment outcomes.",444,163,,,,,"In total, 444 young people participated in STP from 1 April 2019 to 1 Feb 2021. Approximately 37% of the total cohort (n=163) were active in the program at 1 Feb 2021. At this time, 197 young people (44%) had completed the program and 59 young people (13%) had exited the program. To date,144 young people (32%) found employment while with STP. Employment is recorded in cases where a young person engaged in at least one approved hour of paid work. On average, it took young people 15 weeks to find work from STP commencement and each worker undertook, on average, 22 paid hours per week. Approximately 42% of young
people recorded more than 400 approved employment hours, 11% higher than among all participants. About twothirds of participants (63%, 90 young people) who found employment recorded four consecutive weeks of work (of at least 3 hours per week), which dropped to 25% at 13 weeks and 6% at 26 weeks.",
